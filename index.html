              <p>Current DeFi solutions cover mostly restrictive collateralised capital limited to other crypto-assets.</p>
              <p>Innflux is bridging this gap to turn institutional real-time trade flows into credit lines.</p>
              <p>Innflux is the first credit layer to recycle idle DEX liquidity into risk adjusted trade-finance lines for emerging-market SMEs—combining real-time on-chain risk scoring with off-chain invoice, bank and bureau data.</p>
              <p>Innflux is solving the multi-trillion dollar institutional credit gap in frontier markets.</p>
              <p>Stablecoins have already solved a medium of exchange problem for cross-border settlements.</p>
              <p>Yet, credit access to enterprises is still gate-kept via private lenders.</p>
              <p>Traditional banks price cross-border credit risk conservatively in emerging markets sticking to outdated frameworks that omit on-chain activity and stable coin usage.</p>
              <p>This reliance on outdated risk frameworks renders them unable to provide appropriate credit to growing enterprises.</p>
